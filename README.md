  ### Return on investment

  Through researching prior iterations of the annual Pontypool Party in The Park events and exploring Council Committee meeting agenda minutes I've learned that the Pontypool Community Council (PCC) budget around £30k for this event - being the most expensive event in the local community calendar. The PCC currently host a single page to promote the event on their website (https://pontypoolcc.gov.uk/community-information/annual-events/party-in-the-park/) and I've found this iteration to be ineffective in attracting and incentivising attendance. It serves the purpose of presenting the event's existence, clarifies the event date and cost, and has a supporting image gallery and a link to social media, but does not serve to incentivise and motivate attendance and engagement with the event. There is a lack of call-to-action points and aside from the option of viewing further details on social media, there is no option for potential attendees to register their interest directly with the site organisers and be kept up-to-date on event news efficiently.
  
  By designing and implementing a new site page that acknowledges the current shortfalls and prioritises engagement with the local community and incentivises attendance, we can work to achieve the following goals:

  - Increased attendance/footfall at the event.
  - Increased levels of spending - improving the local economy and visibility of local small businesses.
  - Increased exposure to the local area and the social/commercial opportunities available.
  - Increased awareness of charitable causes.
  - Promotion of the local community unique to Pontypool, bolstering social cohesion and engagement.
  - Promotion of local initiatives and talents.
  - Generate sponsorship opportunities.


  ### Audience Perception

  To ensure site visitors are provided with crucially positive impressions of the event and are motivated to attend, this project will work towards achieving the following key goals:

  - The site content is fun, simplistic and engaging.
  - The site is attractive and motivational to a range of different cultural and social demographics and is positively inclusive in nature.
  - The site uses modern design trends and is accessible to a wide range of screen sizes and device mediums.
  - The site offers interactivity that generates further engagement.
  - The site complies with all necessary ARIA accessibility requirements, including making use of semantic HTML elements, to aid compatiblilty with screen-reader technologies.


  ### Increased turnover and revenue

  Through identifying the criteria which are required to achieve the target of increased attendance and site-user conversion, I can reasonably speculate that increased footfall and attendance along with increased options for retail opportunities will all combine to promote spending at the event with event traders, including small businesses in the vicinity of the event not directly involved.


  ### Increased engagement with target audiences & driving efficient conversion rates

  By assessing the current shortfalls in engagement facilities within the current PCC event site and planning a suitable and progressive alternative facility that promotes engagement and drives site user conversion (by way of a registration form), I'm confident in achieving the site owner’s goals. Through the use of engaging, informative yet simple-to-assimilate information, and essential call-to-action points strategically placed intermittently throughout the page, this project site will encourage fruitful and useful site user engagement that will convert to tangible benefits for the event organisers, local community businesses and event attendees combined.

  ### Increased site traffic

  Through implementing efficient and validated HTML5 and CSS3 code that culminates in a well-designed site layout, which is functional and achieves all site user goals, I'm confident that site traffic will improve over the current standard. Efficient and validated code will support SEO ranking and accessibility for all user groups. Site validation will be achieved through the following tools:

  - W3C HTML Validation Service
  - W3C CSS Validation Service
  - Chrome Lighthouse Reports

  ### Culturally-appropriate content

  The proposed site will need to appeal to a diverse range of demographics that are identified through age, race, religion, gender and culture. The area of Pontypool is a relatively diverse environment with age groups across the spectrum, although there is a sizeable volume of retirement-age individuals present. There is a positive attitude towards socialising and due to economic constraints free events are always popular. Whilst I haven't identified any prominent religious groups in the vicinity, I'm aware of several local areas of worship, which implies a necessity to consider the cultural tone of the event and its promotion, ensuring sensitivity to all identifiable groups. 
  
  PCC also host an annual "Pride" event in the same location as Party in The Park and, through attendance last year, I learned of the importance of the LGBTQ+ community being recognised and treated with inclusivity and respect. Provided all content on the site is respectful and not discriminatory, promotes positivity and recognises the various demographics residing in the local area, I'm confident this approach to communication with the community will garner increased attendance and revenues, whilst fostering a positive environment and atmosphere.

  ### Relevance to the local community

  To ensure site visitors have a postive experience and gain a sense of familiarity to the event prior to attendance, I need to pay particular attention to include relevant information that helps promote the local area and ultimately drive attendance. 

  - Images need to exhibit the Pontypool Park environment and atmosphere.
  - Copy needs to reflect the cultural and social nuances of the surrounding population.
  - Essential information needs to be factual, accessible and easy to digest.
  
  ### Intuitive presentation

  The site will need to be intuitive and designed around the common expectations of general website visitors. To achieve this I will:

  - Ensure the site layout is logical in order, prioritising the most essential information first
  - Provide a fixed navigation bar to support site users and avoid laborious scrolling and poor user experience
  - Include relevant image content to support neighbouring copy
  - Any sections of information that are considerable in size need to be presented using specific elements which have been designed to help condense information and present detail  effectively

  ### Technology choices

  A core goal of this site to make use of the HTML5 and CSS3 coding languages proficiently, to ensure a fully functioning and effective resource is available to potential event attendees. 
  
  - Using HTML5 along with Bootstrap library components will help achieve formatting and layout choices. 
  - CSS3 styling will help coordinate the aesthetic of the site, promote consistency and ensure compatibility with different screen sizes.
  - Relevant Font Awesome iconography will help users understand and engage with content contained within the site.
  - Interactive form elements will drive user engagement with the event and the organisers.
  - Embedded resources from Google Maps will help provide site users with a valuable tool, useful in promoting event attendance.
